            "text": "Deep within the walls of Venoriaea, Vicanti readies his {o.Alex.g@son} Alex for an important mission. It is a rite of passage on the {o.Alex.g@prince}'s 16th birthday to lead a small force through the west forest to Dardoine in order to maintain relations with the neighbouring country. It is customary to also provide a gift to the king of Dardoine as a goodwill.\n\nAs Alex holds out {o.Alex.g@his2} hand to accept the gift of the king of Dardoine, a castle guard opens the door and shouts excitedly.\n\n\"My lord, forgive the intrusion, but the queen has returned from her mission!\"\n\n\"Bring her here at once\", Vicanti exclaims.\n\nThe guard takes his leave, off to escort the queen to the throne room.\n\nAlex takes the present and stores it safely in {o.Alex.g@his2} bag. Moments later, the door opens again. A lady dressed in battle armour appears.\n\n\"My lord, I Astraea have returned from battle. What orders do you have next?\"\n\nVicanti explained to his wife that she must accompany Alex on {o.Alex.g@his2} mission to Dardoine. He argued that it would be better if both the {o.Alex.g@prince} and queen of Venoriaea visited the Dardoine king. Astraea agreed passionately, with a sense of duty. \n\nVicanti signaled to the guard to let Astraea leave. Once the queen retired to her quarters, Vicanti resumed his instruction.\n\n\"Though the primary goal of this mission is to preserve relations with Dardoine, it is also important that you learn how to manage a small force. For this mission you will be expected to recruit a group of soldiers to help complete the challenges that lie ahead. Astraea will join in your party, but you will be in charge of finding the others.\"\n\nVicanti presented Alex with a bag of coins.\n\n\"This money should be enough to find some good recruits, Come see me again when you have formed your party.\"\n\nA guard opens the door to let Alex leave the room.",
