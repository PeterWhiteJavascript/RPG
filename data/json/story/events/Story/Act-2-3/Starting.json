            "text": "Today\u2019s travels bring you and a small party of your followers into a village called Coringos. There, you are to speak with the village\u2019s leader, a priest and lord named Elder Vicus about the rebellion and see if you can win his trust. As a lord with some considerable pull in the outlying lands, you could improve your influence considerably by having him as an ally. Briony warned you however that he is highly religious and not too popular.\n\tUpon entering the town, you are greeted by the sight of five or six children playing a game. It seems they are pretending to fight a battle, using sticks as swords and spears. All of them are boys, except for one girl who is not playing with the main group but crouched in the grass, looking for a stick of her own. When she finds one, she rushes in to meet the boys in battle, but the game ceases immediately when she joins. \nThe largest of the boys speaks up, saying \u201cGirls are of the earth, this is a battle for boys. Elder Vicus says that Venor made girls for wifeing and farming, not for fighting!\u201d\n\tLooking dejected and with tears in her eyes, she turns to leave the boys, and spots you coming up the road. She shouts, excitedly \u201cReal warriors!\u201d and runs up to greet you. The boys are not far behind.\n\n{alexGender}\n\nBefore you have a chance to respond, the boy who spoke against her before interjects \u201cThat\u2019s Tecra, Elder Vicus\u2019s daughter. I think she\u2019s never read the scriptures.\u201d\n\tShe seems angry and embarrassed \u2018Yes I have!\u201d she shouts\n\tThe boy responds \u201cShe talks like she never has.\u201d\n\tDuring all of the noise, you didn\u2019t notice the approach of a tall, firm looking man in his fifties. He is wearing the robes of a priest, and from his stately presence, you assume that he must be Elder Vicus. He speaks \u201cSo you must be [Title] Alex. I heard you would be coming. My apologies for my daughter, she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n\tTecra pulls on your shirt then and speaks up \u201cAlex you\u2019re a real warrior. Tell my dad that I can be one too.\u201d\n",
