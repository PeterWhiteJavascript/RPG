Probably don't run the rand-character.php. It was a fun idea, but is sort of pointless.

It takes a json file and creates inputs for all data in the json. 
This means it loops through every array and object and creates an input for each value.
It's probably just better to create a custom tool for any json that needs editing as my generic code here bring out every variable.
